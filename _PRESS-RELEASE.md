There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Mighty Me is a web-application dashboard build to simplify the technical experience of daily digital activities for users currently living with the progressions of neuro-cognitive disabilities.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Mighty Me is specifically built for users currently dealing with neuro-cognitive disabilities. It's purpose is to aid users in independently fulfilling some of their more common daily digital activities, inclusive of messaging their care teams, researching news outlets, and reminsicing on happy snapshots in life.

## Summary ##
  > Mighty Me is a web-application dashboard build to simplify the technical experience of daily digital activites for users currently living with the progressions of neuro-cognitive disabilities. While many of today's most popular tech products build upon and assume a certain degree of technical understanding and proficiency from their respctive userbases, Mighty Me champions the simple and clean for it's userbase whose abilities are moving in the opposite direction. With Mighty Me, users can maintain a higher degree of digital independence and continue living a more connected lifestyle.


## Problem ##
  > Many of today's most popular tech products build upon and assume a certain degree of technical understanding and proficiency from their respective userbases. As beneficial as this is, it does silo a field of potential/ former users from being able to keep up with the technical architecture of these applications. For users currently dealing with neoro-cognitive disabilities, their ability to navigate these digital platforms can become a stressful, complicated and sometimes impossible task.

## Solution ##
  > Mighty Me aims to alleviate some of the stressors of navigating tech platforms by rolling some of the more common applications into a signle dashboard for its userbase. These common activities include messaging care teams, independently researching the latest categorical news and updates, and browsing through photographs.

## Quote from You ##
  > "I am convinced that tech products should be built for their userbase, not the other way around. Follow that rule of thumb, and at the very least your product will have made somebody's life better. That makes it a product worth building."
